# Development

[nix](https://nixos.org/) package manager is required for development.
To install it, use:

```bash
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
```

... then logout and login again for changes to take effect.

## Clone project to local disk

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zoranbosnjak/asterix-specs.git

dependencies for the first time or when switching to a new version of
nix packages.  Subsequent rebuilds on local changes are reasonably fast.
